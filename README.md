# Cubes
A webpage that displays cubes in a somewhat pretty manner


Hello


This is a single html/javascript page that displays "3D" cubes
The interesting stuff is in Cubes.js

I run it by using http-server from npm

I was looking at some 3d cubes one day when I had some ideas. The basis of my idea was tha the corners of the cubes fell along the same concentric circles, but that ended up being pretty much irrelevant to the way this final project works.
I don't know how the math works. It's not the intended effect I was going for, but after I reworked it in a way that I understood, I actually liked this original look better. So I'm sticking with my mystery math.
This is mostly on github to not get lost. I'd like to add the ability to put this effect on an uploaded image rather than just cubes.
